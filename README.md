Hello! 

This is a repository with projects using Wwise for interactive Audio

Feel free to download and explore them

## Dead Space Music Redesign
Contains a Reaper project that sends events to Wwise with MIDI notes. You will need to use a virtual MIDI Port (like Loop MIDI) and setup the Port in the Control Surface and assign in the "Control Surface Bindings". Then, add this [video](https://youtu.be/4qvTF32bQKc) into the Reaper project to see Wwise in action!
